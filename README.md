# Sequential Meta-Analysis Research Trace (SMART)
This repository contains the R code illustrating the Sequential Meta-Analysis Research Trace (SMART), as introduced in The Sequential Nature of Science: Quantifying Learning from a Sequence of Studies (Mikhaeil, Green, & Blei, 2025). [Read the full paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14996).

The code is organized in the following way:

1) Practical Implementation (Vignette.rmd): A guided walkthrough featuring simple examples of how to apply SMART to standard meta-analysis datasets.

2) Reproducibility (Figures.rmd): The exact scripts needed to recreate every figure found in the original paper.
